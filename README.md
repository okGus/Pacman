### Pacman in Python with PyGame

Modified as Vax-Man
Modified rules:
Markup : 
  * Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
  * Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
  * Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
  * The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.

This is a very minimal implementation of the Pacman game, having only one level and without ghosts strategy, not even with random movements (yes, the routes are programmed). However, we may improve this game in the future and everyone else interested can feel free to fork and contribute to this project.
